## Repos

### What's here (and not):
Generally, repos I have created for teaching. I enjoy mentoring so my public repos usually reflect some effort in that direction. The overwhelming majority of my work, most of which is work product from private contracts, is kept private, along with anything that no longer interests me.

### Current Repos:
Since, 2022 I've been creating resources for those new to Web3 Security and released much of this as a series of "books" on the subject. That ongoing project, which is available at [df3ndr.com](https://df3ndr.com), has [an associated repo for issues and collaboration on github](https://github.com/DF3NDR/web3_security).

I also have a number of Solidity Smart Contract example repos that I've created while showing junior developers different concepts.  These include:
- [Proxy Upgrade Contracts Example](https://github.com:Am0rfu5/ProxyUpgrade)
- [NFTs Using Foundry](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFTFoundry)
- [A NFT Raffle using Hardhat and Chainlink VRF](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFT-raffle)
- [An exploration of Vitalik's Concept for a SouldBound Token](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/soulbound-token)
- [A Yield Farm built with Foundry that uses a React UI integrated with Metamask](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/yield-farm-demo)

There are also some Rust specific resources:
- [Data Structures and Algorithms using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/rust_data_structures_algorithms)
- [A mock CEX trading-platform design / Matching Engine](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/trading-platform)
- [An intro to WASM tutorial using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/hello-wasm-tutorial)

## About 🔍

> "Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." - Charles Mingus

My experience working as a developer, data integration specialist, and systems architect spans dozens of companies ranging in size from "Mom & Pop" to Fortune 500. This has been almost entirely as an independent contractor which has provided me the opportunity to be exposed to a wide range of technology stacks, design and development architectures and to maintain long term contracts and relationships.

One of the downsides to being a contractor is that "work product" is proprietary and so opportunities to create open source software are limited unless it is simply for passion. Consequently more often than not my projects are done as educational examples I use with junior developers I am mentoring. At this point I have pulled down most of my earlier repos because they have become technologically dated and more importantly don't relate to what I am focused on in the present. 

In 2016 I was introduced to Ethereum by Joe Lubin and it was immediately apparent that what would come to be known as Web3 had the potential to transform society in an incredibly positive way. This was the beginning of long journey it what would become my sole focus as I've gone on to attend a multitude of conferences, meetups and other events and worked on a variety of projects.

In mid-2022 I shifted toward performing Security Audits for Smart Contracts and Blockchain systems. At that time there was not a lot of information on the subject so and I found the researchers I worked with to be siloed. So I set out to provide people entering the field with a helping hand by developing resources. This led me to write a series of books meant to help make entry into the world of Web3 Security more accessible. While these are by no means complete, I have decided to make the most current versions available at https://df3ndr.com.

It should be clear that I am all in on Web3. It is a passion and something I am devoted to seeing to fruition. I am always looking for new opportunities to work with others who share this passion and are looking to make a positive impact on the world.
