## About 🔍

> "Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." - Charles Mingus

My experience working as a developer, data integration specialist, and systems architect spans dozens of companies ranging in size from "Mom & Pop" to Fortune 500. This has been almost entirely as an independent contractor which has provided me the opportunity to maintain long term contracts and relationships.

In 2016 I was introduced to Ethereum by Joe Lubin and it was immediately apparent that what would come to be known as Web3 had the potential to transform society in an incredibly positive way. This was the beginning of long journey it what would become my sole focus as I've gone on to attend a multitude of conferences, meetups and other events and worked on a variety of projects.

In mid-2022 I shifted toward performing Security Audits for Smart Contracts and Blockchain systems. At that time there was not a lot of information on the subject so and I found the researchers I worked with to be siloed. So I set out to provide new people entering the field with a helping hand by developing resources as I learned more.  This led me to write a series of books meant to help make entry into the world of Web3 Security more accessible. While these are by no means complete, I have decided to make the most current versions available at https://df3ndr.com.

It should be clear that I am all in on Web3. It is a passion and something I am devoted to seeing to fruition. I am always looking for new opportunities to work with others who share this passion and are looking to make a positive impact on the world.
