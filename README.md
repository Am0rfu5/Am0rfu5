For my most recent work see GeniusVentures GNUS.ai repos:

- [GNUS.ai Smart Contracts](https://github.com/GeniusVentures/gnus-ai): EVM compatible contracts (Solidity) and related deployment, monitory and validation for the GNUS Blockchain system.
- [Hardhat-Mulitchain](https://github.com/GenuisVentures/hardhat-multichain): A node module for launching multiple Hardhat forked chains locally. 
- [Diamonds](https://github.com/GeniusVentures/diamonds): A node module deploying, upgrading, validating and monitoring ERC-2535 Diamond Proxy Standard Contract systems.
- [ERC20-GNUS-Proxy Smart Contracts]((https://github.com/GeniusVentures/erc20-gnus-proxy): Proxy Contracts for creating or bridging ERC20 tokens on the GNUS Blockchain system.
- [Hardhat-Diamonds](https://github.com/GeniusVentures/hardhat-diamonds): A node module for setting configurations in hardhat.config.ts and performing tasks associated with the Diamonds module.

My blockchain security books and blog can be found at [df3ndr.com](https://df3ndr.com)

The public repos featured in the profile are primarily instructional, experimental, or just for fun.  I may be adding more of my projects as I clean them of any security risks or I may just create some new projects that fit this space.

### Web3 Repos:
Since, 2021 I've been creating resources for those new to Web3 Security and released much of this as a series of "books" on the subject. That and other projects are available at [df3ndr.com](https://df3ndr.com).

I also have a number of Solidity Smart Contract example repos that I've created while showing junior developers different concepts.  These include:
- [Proxy Upgrade Contracts Example](https://github.com:Am0rfu5/ProxyUpgrade)
- [NFTs Using Foundry](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFTFoundry)
- [A NFT Raffle using Hardhat and Chainlink VRF](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFT-raffle)
- [An exploration of Vitalik's Concept for a SoulBound Token](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/soulbound-token)
- [A Yield Farm built with Foundry that uses a React UI integrated with Metamask](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/yield-farm-demo)

There are also some Rust specific resources:
- [Data Structures and Algorithms using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/rust_data_structures_algorithms)
- [A mock CEX trading-platform design / Matching Engine](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/trading-platform)
- [An intro to WASM tutorial using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/hello-wasm-tutorial)

## About 🔍

> "Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." - Charles Mingus

My experience working as a developer, data integration specialist, systems architect and cybersecurity professional spans dozens of companies ranging in size from "Mom & Pop" to Fortune 500. This has been almost entirely as an independent contractor which has provided me the opportunity to be exposed to a wide range of technology stacks, design and development architectures and to maintain long term contracts and relationships.

In 2016, while living in Bushwick, Brooklyn I was introduced to Ethereum by Joe Lubin.  It was immediately apparent that what would come to be known as Web3 had the potential to transform society in an incredibly positive way. This was the beginning of a journey that would define a large part of my professional work for the past 8 years. Attending and volunteering at a multitude of conferences, meetups and other events and working on a variety of projects, I have been all in on Web3 ever since.

In mid-2022 I shifted entirely toward performing Security Audits for Smart Contracts and Blockchain systems. At that time there was not a lot of information on the subject and I found the researchers I worked with to be siloed and unwilling to share their knowledge. My repsonse was to take the opposite approach and provide any assistance I could to people entering the field by developing resources. The result is a a series of books meant to help make entry into the world of Web3 Security more accessible. While these are by no means complete, I have decided to make the most current versions available at https://df3ndr.com.

I am deeply passionate about Web3. It is something I am devoted to seeing to fruition as a replacement for the current paradigm of centralized legacy systems. I am always looking for new opportunities to work with others who share this passion and are looking to make a positive impact on the world.
