## Who you?

I've been programming for over 40 years. That is a long time. Over that time I have come to place privacy at a very high value.  This has a detrimental effect on public reputation, one that has been generally acceptable in the security community. For the majority of my career my work has been for private contracts, and so is kept private, along with anything that no longer interests me. However, that doesn't mean I haven't contributed, just that I choose not to disclose that contribution publicly.

FOSS softare has been a huge part of my life. I love to give back to the communities that I have gained so much from.  The repos here are the part of that which I feel comfortable with as an exposure directly IRL.  Much of it is simply instructional. There may also be experimental repos that I do just for fun but I try to keep these fairly current to keep the public facing repos uncluttered.

### Web3 Repos:
Since, 2021 I've been creating resources for those new to Web3 Security and released much of this as a series of "books" on the subject. That ongoing project, which is available at [df3ndr.com](https://df3ndr.com).

I also have a number of Solidity Smart Contract example repos that I've created while showing junior developers different concepts.  These include:
- [Proxy Upgrade Contracts Example](https://github.com:Am0rfu5/ProxyUpgrade)
- [NFTs Using Foundry](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFTFoundry)
- [A NFT Raffle using Hardhat and Chainlink VRF](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/NFT-raffle)
- [An exploration of Vitalik's Concept for a SouldBound Token](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/soulbound-token)
- [A Yield Farm built with Foundry that uses a React UI integrated with Metamask](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/yield-farm-demo)

There are also some Rust specific resources:
- [Data Structures and Algorithms using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/rust_data_structures_algorithms)
- [A mock CEX trading-platform design / Matching Engine](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/trading-platform)
- [An intro to WASM tutorial using Rust](https://github.com/Am0rfu5/hello-wasm-tutorial)

## About 🔍

> "Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity." - Charles Mingus

My experience working as a developer, data integration specialist, systems architect and cybersecurity professional spans dozens of companies ranging in size from "Mom & Pop" to Fortune 500. This has been almost entirely as an independent contractor which has provided me the opportunity to be exposed to a wide range of technology stacks, design and development architectures and to maintain long term contracts and relationships.

In 2016, while living in Bushwick, Brooklyn near the Morgan Ave L line subway station and I wsa introduced to Ethereum by Joe Lubin.  It was immediately apparent that what would come to be known as Web3 had the potential to transform society in an incredibly positive way. This was the beginning of a journey that would define a large part of my life for most of the next decade and continuing to this day. Attending and volunteering at a multitude of conferences, meetups and other events and working on a variety of projects, I have been all in on Web3 ever since.

In mid-2022 I shifted toward performing Security Audits for Smart Contracts and Blockchain systems. At that time there was not a lot of information on the subject so and I found the researchers I worked with to be siloed. So I set out to provide people entering the field with a helping hand by developing resources. This led me to write a series of books meant to help make entry into the world of Web3 Security more accessible. While these are by no means complete, I have decided to make the most current versions available at https://df3ndr.com.

It should be clear that I am deeply passionate about Web3. It is something I am devoted to seeing to fruition as a replacement for the current paradigm of centralized legacy systems. I am always looking for new opportunities to work with others who share this passion and are looking to make a positive impact on the world.
